## 👋 About Me

I am a Master’s graduate in Artificial Intelligence from **Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)**, with a strong interest in **applied AI research and industry-facing machine learning systems**. My work bridges research ideas and real-world implementation, particularly in **LLM reasoning, prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning**.

My Master’s research explored **critic-guided synthesis for visual reasoning**, focusing on how large language models can trace, interpret, and correct programs through structured prompts and adaptive feedback signals. I enjoy building end-to-end systems that combine solid engineering practices with modern deep learning techniques.

I am currently seeking **industry AI or applied research roles** where I can contribute to impactful AI-driven products and research teams.
